# toggl-to-google-sheets-sync-via-integromat-make
A scenario that syncs newly changed Toggl time tracking items, updating rows that are already in the sheet, and adding rows that aren't.  Any changes made to Toggl time tracking items sync back to the google sheet every 15 minutes. This 'blueprint' can be imported into Integromat Make as a scenario. It can run on the free plan (as of 2022-07-06)
